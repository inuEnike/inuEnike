### Howdy, I'm George :happy:

I am a software developer with over 2 years of industry experience creating solutions that solve business and human needs. Skilled in creating optimized and reusable codes using ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, ExpressJs, and NextJs.
I have an eye for details and pay great attention, especially to performance, accessibility, security, and maintainability for web applications.

Aside from developing web applications, I love community building, making resourceful videos to help the community, writing technical articles, and being the best version of myself!
